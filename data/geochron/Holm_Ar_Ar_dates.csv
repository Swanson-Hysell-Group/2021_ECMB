It was cut by some undeformed granite dikelets.  That is from within the Becker embayment.  There is a drill core nearby (EC-15  1786 ± 43 Ma) that is not deformed"""

The metawacke occurs as large xenoliths within the ca. 1793 Ma Warman granite/granodiorite along the north edge of Kanabec County; I believe the metawacke to be inclusions of the Little Falls Formation. I think the Snake River pegmatite predates the ECMB, supported by Holm's 1810 Ar-Ar age."
