\subsubsection*{CA-TIMS U-Pb zircon geochronology methods}

U-Pb dates were obtained by chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) in the Boise State University (BSU) Isotope Geology Laboratory (Table DR1; Fig. \ref{fig:zircon_concordia}). Chemical abrasion of single zircon grains was modified after \cite{Mattinson2005a}. Zircons were separated from rocks using standard techniques, annealed in a muffle furnace at 900\textdegree C for 60 hours in quartz crucibles, and imaged by cathodoluminescence in grain mounts (Fig. \ref{fig:zircon_CL}).

\label{fig:zircon_CL}
\end{figure}

Individual zircons were removed from grain mounts and chemically abraded. Chemical abrasion was carried out by transferring zircons to 3 ml Teflon Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) beakers in which they were rinsed in 3.5 M HNO$_\mathrm{3}$ and ultrapure H$_\mathrm{2}$O prior to loading into 300 $\mu$l Teflon PFA microcapsules. Fifteen microcapsules were placed in a large-capacity Parr vessel and the zircon partially dissolved in 120 $\mu$l of 29 M HF for 12 hours at 190\textdegree C. Zircons were returned to 3 ml Teflon PFA beakers, HF was removed, and zircons were immersed in 3.5 M HNO$_\mathrm{3}$, ultrasonically cleaned for an hour, and fluxed on a hotplate at 80°C for an hour. The HNO$_\mathrm{3}$ was removed and zircon was rinsed twice in ultrapure H2O before being reloaded into the 300 $\mu$l Teflon PFA microcapsules (rinsed and fluxed in 6 M HCl during sonication and washing of the zircons) and spiked with the $^{233}$U-$^{235}$U-$^{205}$Pb BSU tracer solution (BSU1B). Zircons were dissolved in Parr vessels in 120 $\mu$l of 29 M HF at 220\textdegree C for 48 hours, dried to fluorides, and re-dissolved in 6 M HCl at 180\textdegree C overnight. Pb and U were separated from the zircon matrix using an HCl-based anion-exchange chromatographic procedure \citep{Krogh1973a}, eluted together and dried with 2 $\mu$l of 0.05 N H$_\mathrm{3}$PO$_\mathrm{4}$.

Pb and U were loaded on a single outgassed Re filament in 5 $\mu$l of a silica-gel/phosphoric acid mixture \citep{Gerstenberger1997a}, and Pb and U isotopic measurements made on a GV Isoprobe-T multicollector thermal ionization mass spectrometer equipped with an ion-counting Daly detector. Pb isotopes were measured by peak-jumping all isotopes on the Daly detector for 190 cycles with a mass bias correction of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.03$\%$/a.m.u. (1$\sigma$). Transitory isobaric interferences due to high-molecular weight organics, particularly on $^{204}$Pb and $^{207}$Pb, disappeared within 30-45 cycles, while ionization efficiency averaged 104 cps/pg of each Pb isotope. Linearity (to $\geq$1.4 x 10$^6$ cps) and the associated deadtime correction of the Daly detector were determined by analysis of NBS982. Uranium was analyzed as UO$_2^+$ ions in static Faraday mode on 10$^{12}$ ohm resistors for up to 300 cycles, and corrected for isobaric interference of $^{233}$U$^{18}$O$^{16}$O on $^{235}$U$^{16}$O$^{16}$O with an $^{18}$O/$^{16}$O of 0.00206. Ionization efficiency averaged 20 mV/ng of each U isotope. U mass fractionation was corrected using the $^{233}$U/$^{235}$U ratio of the BSU1B tracer.

\label{fig:zircon_concordia}
\end{figure}

CA-TIMS U-Pb dates and uncertainties were calculated using the algorithms of \cite{Schmitz2007b}, BSU1B tracer solution with calibration of $^{235}$U/$^{205}$Pb = 77.93 and $^{233}$U/$^{235}$ = 1.007066, and U decay constants recommended by \cite{Hiess2012a}, including $^{238U}$/$^{235}$U of 137.818. $^{206}$Pb/$^{238}$U ratios and dates were corrected for initial $^{230}$Th disequilibrium using DTh/U = 0.20 $\pm$ 0.05 (1$\sigma$). All common Pb in analyses was attributed to laboratory blank and subtracted based on the measured laboratory Pb isotopic composition and associated uncertainty. U blanks are estimated at 0.013 pg. CA-TIMS weighted mean $^{207}$Pb/$^{206}$Pb dates were calculated from equivalent dates (pof $>$0.05) using Isoplot 3.0 \citep{Ludwig2003a}. Errors on the weighted mean dates are given as $\pm$ x / z, where x is the internal error based on analytical uncertainties including counting statistics, subtraction of tracer solution, and blank and initial common Pb subtraction; z also includes the U decay constant uncertainties propagated in quadrature. Dates from individual zircon fractions and weighted mean dates are reported at 2$\sigma$.

\subsubsection*{LA-ICP-MS U-Pb apatite geochronology methods}

Apatite U-Pb geochronology data were developed via laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) at UC Santa Barbara. U-Pb isotopes were analyzed with a Cetac Teledyne 193 nm excimer Analyte laser with a HelEx ablation cell coupled to a Nu Instruments Plasma 3D multi-collector (MC) ICP-MS. On the Plasma 3D, $^{204}$(Pb+Hg), $^{206}$Pb, $^{207}$Pb, and $^{208}$Pb were measured on Daly detectors and $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th were measured on Faraday collectors. Apatite was ablated with a 40 $\mu$m diameter laser spot for 60 pulses fired at a 4 Hz repetition rate and 50$\%$ of 5 mJ laser power. Each ablation sequence consisted of 2 cleaning shots, followed by 25 secs of monitored washout and 15 secs of ablation. The Iolite v. 2.5 program \citep{Paton2011a} in the Igor Pro software environment was used to correct the raw U-Pb ratios for baselines, laser- and plasma-induced element fractionation, and instrument drift.

Multiple apatite reference materials (RMs) were analyzed throughout the analytical session to monitor data quality. Apatite RM Madagascar (478.4 $\pm$ 6.1 Ma, ID-TIMS age; \citealp{Thomson2012a}) served as the primary bracketing standard with RMs McClure (523.5 $\pm$ 1.5 Ma, ID-TIMS age; \citealp{Schoene2006a}), 401 (530.3 $\pm$ 1.5 Ma, ID-ICP-MS age; \citealp{Thompson2016a}) and OD306 (1596.7 $\pm$ 7.1 Ma, ID-ICP-MS age; \citealp{Thompson2016a}) analyzed as secondary standards to assess precision and accuracy. All of the secondary standards form mixing arrays between common-Pb and an age intercept. The excess variances of $^{206}$Pb/$^{238}$U and $^{207}$Pb/$^{206}$Pb required for secondary standards to conform to a statistically single mixing line are 2.1$\%$ and 2.0$\%$ (2$\sigma$), respectively; these values were added in quadrature to the internal uncertainties of each U-Pb datum \citep{Horstwood2016a}. The ages of the secondary standards with these designated uncertainties are 547.4 ± 30.4/35.9 Ma (McClure), 512.8 $\pm$ 9.8/10.5 Ma (401), 1586.5 $\pm$ 14.9/15.7 Ma (OD306) (uncertainties following the same format used in main text), within uncertainty of their published ages. Although mass-204 was measured on the MC-ICP-MS, isobaric interferences with $^{204}$Hg in the He carrier gas preclude the use of the $^{204}$Pb method for common-Pb corrections. The U-Pb apatite data are reported in Table S2.
